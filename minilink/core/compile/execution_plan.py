"""
Execution plan data structures for compiled diagrams.

An :class:`ExecutionPlan` is the output of the compilation step: it captures,
in an immutable and flattened form, all the information needed to evaluate a
:class:`~minilink.core.diagram.DiagramSystem` without any dictionary lookups
or recursive calls.

The plan is consumed by evaluator backends
(:class:`~minilink.core.compile.evaluators.numpy_evaluator.NumpyDiagramEvaluator`,
:class:`~minilink.core.compile.evaluators.jax_evaluator.JaxDiagramEvaluator`) which walk through the
operation lists in topological order to compute state derivatives and outputs.

class PortOperation:
    """One output-port evaluation step in topological order.

    When a diagram is compiled, every output port becomes a PortOperation.
    During evaluation, operations execute sequentially in topological order:
    for each operation, gather the local input vector ``u`` from the signal
    buffer, call the compute function, and write the result into the buffer.

    Attributes
    ----------
    compute_func : Callable[..., np.ndarray]
        The port's compute function ``(x, u, t, params) → y``.
        ``params`` may be ``None`` (use live ``self.params`` in the block) or a
        bound snapshot when ``bind_params=True`` at compile time.
    local_x_slice : slice
        Index slice into the global state vector ``x`` that extracts this
        subsystem's local state.  For static systems (``n = 0``): ``slice(0, 0)``.
    gather_sources : tuple[tuple[int, Any, int], ...]
        Recipe for assembling the local input vector ``u`` from various sources.
        Each entry is ``(source_type, source_value, dim)`` where:

        - ``source_type = NOMINAL (0)``:
          Port not connected or not a dependency.
          ``source_value`` is the constant ``np.ndarray`` (nominal value).
        - ``source_type = EXTERNAL_INPUT (1)``:
          From the diagram's external input vector.
          ``source_value`` is a ``slice`` into the diagram's ``u``.
        - ``source_type = INTERNAL_SIGNAL (2)``:
          From another subsystem's output.
          ``source_value`` is a ``slice`` into the internal signal buffer.
    out_slice : slice
        Where to write this port's output in the internal signal buffer.
    u_dim : int
        Total dimension of the assembled local input vector.
        Equal to the sum of all ``dim`` values in ``gather_sources``.
    bound_params : dict | None
        If set, a deep copy of the subsystem ``params`` at compile time; passed
        as the fourth argument to ``compute_func``. If ``None``, evaluators pass
        ``None`` so blocks use their default ``self.params``. This does not
        freeze other instance attributes; purity of ``compute_func`` is not
        enforced.
    sys_id : str
        Id of the owning subsystem in the diagram. Used by the parametric
        evaluator tier to route nested diagram params (``params[sys_id]``).

    Similar to :class:`PortOperation`, but calls ``f(x, u, t) → dx`` instead

    vector ``dx`` at ``local_x_slice``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    f_func : Callable[..., np.ndarray]
        The subsystem's state-derivative function ``(x, u, t, params) → dx``.

    local_x_slice : slice

        ``dx`` for this subsystem's local state.
    gather_sources : tuple[tuple[int, Any, int], ...]
        Recipe for assembling the local input vector ``u``.

        function always needs **all** inputs (no dependency filtering).
    u_dim : int
        Total dimension of the assembled local input vector.
    bound_params : dict | None
        Same semantics as :attr:`PortOperation.bound_params` for ``f_func``
