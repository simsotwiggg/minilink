"""Manual trajectory-optimization solver-preset benchmark runner.

Edit the settings below, then run from the repository root::

    python benchmarks/run_trajopt_solver_presets.py

This script intentionally keeps the sweep small. By default it benchmarks only
direct collocation and a cold start, comparing a NumPy/SLSQP baseline against
JAX analytic-derivative solver presets, including Ipopt when ``cyipopt`` is
installed.
