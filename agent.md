# Minilink AI Agent Instructions

This file is the **source of truth** for AI agents working on `minilink`.
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [.cursor/rules/read-agent-first.mdc](.cursor/rules/read-agent-first.mdc)
are thin auto-injected entry points that point here.

The short version: keep the math readable, keep interfaces thin, and keep docs
synchronized with code.

## 1. Core Directives

- **Math readability first**: equations should read like textbook math, for
  example `dx = A @ x + B @ u`.
- **Mechanical-engineering audience**: code should be reviewable by a reader who
  thinks in systems, signals, and equations before Python abstractions.
- **Coach the architecture**: when a requested change risks adding ceremony,
  name the tradeoff and steer toward the simplest clear interface.
- **Minimalist UX**: keep the main workflow beginner-friendly; push complexity to
  orchestrators and backend modules, not reader-facing scripts.
- **Prototype honestly**: unvalidated architecture may exist, but mark it with
  `TODO: User Architectural Review` and keep it easy to replace.
- **Incremental refactoring**: avoid broad restructures unless the user asks for
  that scope.
- **Docs are contract**: update `DESIGN.md` and `ROADMAP.md` when public
  contracts, package layout, or maturity claims change.

## 2. Coding Standards

### Textbook Style

The core promise: reading minilink should feel like reading a controls and
dynamics textbook. These rules keep it that way as the library grows.

1. **Two-audience principle** (headline rule): every file has a primary
   reader — the *student* (`core/system.py`, `core/signals.py`, `blocks/`,
   `dynamics/`, `control/`) or the *library developer* (`core/compile/`,
   `core/composition.py`, evaluators). Write each file for its
   primary reader; push the other audience's machinery elsewhere.
2. **First-screen rule**: a student-facing module shows its docstring and
   primary class within the first screen. Validation and inference plumbing
   never sits above the contract — it goes below the class or in its own
   module (e.g. `core/signals.py`).
3. **Module section order**: primary contract class → subclasses/variants →
   public functions → private helpers at the bottom, separated by short
   section banners (`# Public API`, `# Internal machinery`).
4. **Selector-orchestrator split for math tools**: when a public tool combines
   user options with core equations, keep the public function readable as:
   choose method/options, get selected `f(x, u)` / `h(x, u)` callables, then
   write the mathematical computation in place. Put port selection, backend
   fallback, validation, and other ceremony in one or two small selector
   helpers below the core math. For example, linearization should read like
   `method = selectmethod(...)`; `f, h = selectports(...)`; then `A`, `B`,
   `C`, `D` are computed directly from textbook Jacobian relations.
5. **Bare signatures in equation paths**: `def f(self, x, u, t=0, params=None):`
   — no type annotations in `f`/`h`/port computes; shapes and types live in
   the docstring. Full type hints belong on tools, orchestrators, and
   structural APIs.
6. **The `xp` idiom**: `xp = array_module(x)` right after params unpacking is
   *the* hybrid NumPy/JAX pattern — one line, always the same shape, and the
   entire price of JAX support in basic blocks.
7. **Derived, not cached**: quantities computable from owned state are
   read-only properties (`System.m`, `System.p`), never cached attributes
   guarded by `recompute_*()` call discipline — no staleness class of bugs.
8. **No shadow state**: attributes are initialized in `__init__`, never via
   `hasattr(...)`-or-create at use sites.
9. **Libraries are silent**: no `print` outside explicit `verbose=` flags,
   default quiet. Delete debug scaffolding rather than gating it.
10. **Pre-1.0 no-alias rule**: no compatibility aliases or shims inside the
   library; rename cleanly and fix call sites in the same change.
11. **Backend imports come from `core/backends.py`**: backend vocabulary and
    the `array_module` / `require_jax_numpy` helpers live there; system
    libraries never import from `core/compile/`.
12. **`__main__` hello-worlds**: core modules may end with a ~10-line runnable
    example (`python -m minilink.core.system`); anything bigger belongs in
    `examples/`.

### General

- Python 3.10+; keep `DESIGN.md`, `agent.md`, and `pyproject.toml` aligned when
  behavior or dependencies change.
- Public APIs need type hints and NumPy-style docstrings — **except equation
  paths**, which stay bare (Textbook Style rule 4).
- Keep optional heavy imports lazy.
- Match the neighborhood before editing an existing file.
- Change only what the task requires; every diff line should earn its place.
- Prefer explicit, readable code over clever Python when the data flow is
  mathematical; use named temporaries in equation paths.
- Keep math-tool helper counts low. If option resolution needs a lot of Python,
  put it behind a selector helper that returns clean mathematical callables or
  arrays; do not scatter one-off helpers through the file or let fallback logic
  interrupt the equation block.
- **Avoid single-use private methods.** Do not split a constructor or equation
  into `self._helper()` steps that run only once (e.g. `_set_metadata`,
  `_abcd`); inline them at the call site. Keep a helper only when it is reused,
  recursive, or genuinely clarifies. Module-level functions shared by several
  classes are fine.
- **Tests only when justified**: add or update tests for stable public APIs, TRL
  milestones, documented contracts, or explicit user requests—not for trivial or
  obvious behavior.
- **Validation in proportion**: avoid defensive error-handling sprawl on internal
  paths unless the interface is public or the failure mode is real.
- Use dataclasses for transparent records such as trajectories, execution-plan
  operations, benchmark rows, and results.
- Do not turn scientific objects such as systems, plants, and controllers into
  dataclasses when explicit initialization makes the model clearer.
- Use `ABC` only when contract enforcement is valuable. Plain base classes with
  `NotImplementedError` are fine for Pyro-style mother classes with shared
  defaults and optional hooks.

### Math Naming

- matrices: `A`, `B`, `H`, `M`, `K`;
- vectors: `x`, `u`, `y`, `q`, `v`, `dq`;
- dimensions: `n`, `m`, `p`;
- programmatic ids: `sys_id`, `port_id`, `block_id`;
- display strings: `label`, `labels`.

In public equation paths (`f`, `h`, output-port compute functions, mechanical
hooks, linearization, transcriptions), map inputs once and then use textbook
locals. Avoid repeated `np.asarray`/reshape checks inside internal math paths
unless the helper is a public boundary.

**Unpack `params` before equations:** in equation paths (`H`, `C`, `g`, `d`,
`f`, `h`, …) read each needed value out of the `params` dict into a short local
at the top of the method (`m1 = params["m1"]`, `l1 = params["l1"]`), then write
the formula in those symbols. Keep dict indexing out of the math so the core
equations read like textbook math.

**No `self.` in core equations:** bind matrices and terms returned by methods or
attributes to short locals first (`A = self.A(t, params)`, `H = self.H(q,
params)`), then write the formula in those symbols (`dx = A @ x + B @ u`). The
final equation line should read like math, free of `self.` and dict indexing.

**Let core equations breathe:** separate the core equation from surrounding
bookkeeping with a blank line, and add a short comment naming the relation or
physics it encodes (e.g. the governing ODE), not one that narrates the syntax.

**Lay out matrices as matrices:** write 2-D array literals with one row per line
and columns visually aligned so the structure reads like written math. The
formatter collapses alignment spacing, so wrap an aligned literal in
`# fmt: off` / `# fmt: on` to preserve it.

**Reader-facing imports:** in tutorials, demos, and examples, keep the top of the
file light so the math stays visible. Internal packages (`core/compile/`, `simulation/`,
benchmarks, tests) may use richer imports when the benefit is clear.

### Docs And Comments

- Main public classes and modules should be Sphinx-ready enough to render later:
  NumPy sections, inline code literals, and cross-references where useful.
- Internal helpers and secondary conveniences can use short plain-English
  docstrings.
- Comments stay plain and sparse; add them only where they clarify non-obvious
  logic.
- Do not add new markdown guides unless asked. Prefer updating `README.md`,
  `DESIGN.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, or this file. Keep [README call chains](README.md#call-chains)
  minimal—do not grow step-by-step internal traces in markdown.

## 3. Architecture And Contracts

Canonical contracts live in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). User workflows and minimal
call chains: [README.md](README.md). Update those when you change public behavior.

Quick reminders (details in DESIGN):

- Equation paths (`f`, `h`, ports, sets/costs, programs, transcriptions) stay
  **native-array**; conversions belong at boundaries (evaluators, solvers,
  plotting, `contains`, …).
- `params is None` uses object defaults; any other `params` overrides—never
  `params or self.params`.
- Use **inheritance** for core system types; use **composition** for diagrams
  and optional behaviors. Keep readable modeling in `core/`; isolate compile,
  simulation, optimization, and graphics.
- **Compiled-evaluator vocabulary:** `outputs()` / `outputs_p()` are **boundary
  outputs only**; diagram internals use internal-signal APIs, not `outputs()`.
  Do not reintroduce `compute_outputs(..., ports=...)`. Keep
  `ExecutionPlan.output_slices` and `external_output_slices` aligned. Preserve
  JAX traceability of `f` and port compute paths.
- Changes to evaluator contracts, `ExecutionPlan`, or diagram compile behavior
  must update `DESIGN.md` and, if scope changed, `ROADMAP.md`.

## 4. NumPy And JAX

Library-wide policy is under [DESIGN.md §1](DESIGN.md#numpy-and-jax) (NumPy and
JAX). When implementing: explicit backend arguments (`compile_backend`, evaluator
backends), vocabulary and helpers from `minilink.core.backends`, lazy JAX imports, and
no `minilink.jax` package or global NumPy/JAX mode.

## 5. Package And File Layout

- Import symbols from the module that defines them; package `__init__.py` files are
  namespace markers unless a future public API freeze says otherwise. **Keep each
  `__init__.py`** so subpackages stay discoverable to Hatch and import tooling;
  do not use package `__init__` as a barrel re-export layer.
- Packages belong to one of four bands — framework (`core/`, incl.
  `core/compile/`), system libraries (`blocks/`, `dynamics/`, `control/`,
  `estimation/`), tools (`simulation/`, `analysis/`, `planning/`,
  `optimization/`, `identification/`, `graphical/`, `interfaces/`), and
  quarantine (`symbolic/`). Dependency law and placement
  algorithm: [DESIGN.md §3](DESIGN.md). Shelve library content by *role in
  the diagram*, never by implementation technology; tools never define
  user-facing `System` subclasses (factories are fine).
- Swappable roles use role-specific folders and singular contract modules:
  `core/compile/evaluators/evaluator.py`, `simulation/solvers/solver.py`,
  `graphical/renderers/renderer.py`,
  `optimization/optimizers/optimizer_backend.py`.
- `core/compile/compiler.py` is the compile orchestrator—do not add `compilers/` folders.
- All performance benchmarking (helpers, fixtures, runners) lives in the
  repo-root `benchmarks/` directory — never inside `minilink/` or `tests/`.
  It imports minilink like an external user; nothing in `minilink/` may
  import it (unittest smoke tests may).
- Demo and manual scripts stay flat and runnable from the repo root.

## 6. Verification

After substantial changes, run the full checklist in [§10 Revision Pass](#10-revision-pass).

At feature completion, verify in proportion to risk:

1. automated tests with `pytest`;
2. manual smoke scripts in `tests/manual/` when useful;
3. demo scripts in `examples/` for major user-facing workflows.

JAX twin plants need tests showing JAX equations match the NumPy reference in a
nominal case and a non-trivial parameter regime.

Run ruff on touched Python files. Markdown-only changes do not need ruff unless
Python docstrings were edited.

## 7. Workflow Rules

Do directly:

- fix typos and stale docs;
- add missing public docstrings/type hints in the files you are already touching;
- make small style cleanups that directly support the requested change.

Ask first:

- deleting or renaming files unless the user explicitly asked;
- architecture refactors or public API changes;
- adding dependencies;
- changing evaluator, execution-plan, or optimizer contracts;
- removing user-authored scratch/convenience code.

If a small request turns into a large job after inspection, stop and explain the
smallest useful slice.

If instructions in chat conflict with this file, ask for clarification before
proceeding.

**Notebooks:** exclude notebooks from normal review/style passes unless the task
is only to update renamed imports/API names or the user explicitly asks for
notebook cleanup. Never review notebook outputs by default.

**Scope:**

- **Small tweaks** — quick, minimal source change; no broad refactors unless asked.
- **Larger work** — write a concise implementation plan and wait for explicit
  approval before extended multi-step execution.
- **Scope surprise** — stop and ask which slice the user wants rather than
  grinding forward.

Before handoff on larger work, complete [§10 Revision Pass](#10-revision-pass).

Demo and manual scripts stay flat and runnable from the repo root. Benchmark
helpers, fixtures, and `run_*` scripts live in repo-root `benchmarks/` (see §5).

## 8. TRL Lifecycle

Readiness levels are an internal maturity scale for planning and review—not a
release process by themselves.

| Level | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **TRL 1** | Agent MVP | Initial code exists and works |
| **TRL 2** | User-check MVP | User performs a high-level functional review |
| **TRL 3** | Architecture Validated | High-level architecture is approved |
| **TRL 4** | Integration Proposed | Final integration/refactor is proposed |
| **TRL 5** | Integration Validated | User approves main-codebase integration |
| **TRL 6** | Automated Tests Pass | Final pytest coverage exists and passes |
| **TRL 7** | Details Validated | Naming and implementation details are approved |
| **TRL 8** | Demo Released | Demo script is created and validated |
| **TRL 9** | Mission Complete | Tests, demo, and user approval are all complete |

Subsystem maturity in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) uses these definitions.

## 9. Local Environment

Target **Python 3.10+** with optional extras from `pyproject.toml` (JAX, SymPy,
visualization, Ipopt). Do not rely on macOS `/usr/bin/python3` when it is older
than 3.10. For terminal commands in this repo (tests, `examples/scripts`,
benchmarks), use Python 3.10+ with the extras your task needs.

Install from repo root:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Optional extras: `.[jax]`, `.[symbolic]`, `.[visualization]`, `.[plotting]`,
`.[ipopt]`. Diagram bindings need a system `graphviz` package
(`apt install graphviz`, or conda-forge `graphviz` + `python-graphviz`).

Maintainers often use a conda env for local work (for example `dev-h26`). That
name is **not contractual**—any conda/venv with Python 3.10+ and the extras you
need is fine; align versions with CI or teammates when running tests and examples.

```bash
conda activate dev-h26   # or your own env
python -m pytest
```

```bash
conda run -n dev-h26 python -m pytest
conda run -n dev-h26 python examples/scripts/animation/demo_animations.py
```

Run demos from repo root: `python examples/scripts/<script>.py`.

Headless: set `MPLBACKEND=Agg` before graphical imports. `plot_diagram()` D-Bus
warnings in headless environments are harmless. `animate()` needs a display;
plotting and simulation work headless with `show=False`.

## 10. Revision Pass

Final pass after substantial changes. Goal: a smaller, clearer diff.

1. **Re-read diff** — scope creep, dead code, stale comments; preserve user edits.
2. **Simplify** — match local patterns; thin public APIs; lazy optional imports;
   fail clearly on unsupported paths.
3. **Math-first** — textbook locals in equation paths; conversion at boundaries only
   ([Textbook Style](#textbook-style)).
4. **Examples** — fold or update demos; runnable from repo root; no new guides unless asked.
5. **Docs** — sync [README.md](README.md) (user API), [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)
   (contracts), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) (maturity only if changed). Keep
   [README call chains](README.md#call-chains) minimal—update chains, not
   step-by-step internals
   ([Docs And Comments](#docs-and-comments), [§3 Architecture And Contracts](#3-architecture-and-contracts)).
6. **Tests** — new behavior, regressions, optional-extra skip messages; benchmarks
   only when performance claims matter.
7. **Verify** — `ruff check .`, `ruff format --check .`, `pytest` (proportionate
   to risk; see [§6 Verification](#6-verification)); `MPLBACKEND=Agg` for headless
   graphics smoke.
8. **Handoff** — `git status`, no stray artifacts; short summary of changes and
   verification.
